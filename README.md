## üìù API Documentation

API documentation is available at `http://localhost:3000/api-docs` when running the development server.

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Development Setup

### Frontend (Browser Extension)

The frontend React application is located in the `extension` directory. To develop it:

1. Navigate to the extension directory:
   ```bash
   cd extension
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. For development, start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Build the production version:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This will create a production build in the `extension/build` directory.

**Important Notes:**
- All npm commands must be run from within the `extension` directory
- The build process requires you to be in the `extension` directory to locate necessary files like `public/index.html`

#### Backend Setup

1. **Production Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.production
   ```
   Configure production environment variables:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_production_key
   MONGODB_URI=your_production_mongodb_uri
   JWT_SECRET=your_production_secret
   ```

2. **Docker Deployment**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

### Deployment

#### Extension Deployment

1. **Build the Extension**
   ```bash
   cd extension
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Firefox Submission**
   - Create a zip file of the `extension/build` directory
   - Submit to [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/)
   - Follow Mozilla's [submission guidelines](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/publish/submitting-an-add-on/)

3. **Chrome Web Store**
   - Create a zip file of the `extension/build` directory
   - Submit to [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole/)
   - Follow Google's [submission guidelines](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/publish/)

#### Backend Deployment

1. **Production Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.production
   ```
   Configure production environment variables:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_production_key
   MONGODB_URI=your_production_mongodb_uri
   JWT_SECRET=your_production_secret
   ```

2. **Docker Deployment**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

## Project Dependencies

The frontend uses:
- React 18
- TypeScript
- react-scripts for build tooling

## üìã TODO

There might be a problem with the project dependency tree.
It is likely not a bug in Create React App, but something you need to fix locally.

The react-scripts package provided by Create React App requires a dependency:

  "babel-jest": "^24.9.0"

Don't try to install it manually: your package manager does it automatically.
However, a different version of babel-jest was detected higher up in the tree:

  C:\Users\Cardo\Workspace\middleai\node_modules\babel-jest (version: 27.5.1)

Manually installing incompatible versions is known to cause hard-to-debug issues.

If you would prefer to ignore this check, add SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true to an .env file in your project.
That will permanently disable this message but you might encounter other issues.

To fix the dependency tree, try following the steps below in the exact order:

  1. Delete package-lock.json (not package.json!) and/or yarn.lock in your project folder.
  2. Delete node_modules in your project folder.
  3. Remove "babel-jest" from dependencies and/or devDependencies in the package.json file in your project folder.
  4. Run npm install or yarn, depending on the package manager you use.

In most cases, this should be enough to fix the problem.
If this has not helped, there are a few other things you can try:

  5. If you used npm, install yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/) and repeat the above steps with it instead.
     This may help because npm has known issues with package hoisting which may get resolved in future versions.

  6. Check if C:\Users\Cardo\Workspace\middleai\node_modules\babel-jest is outside your project directory.
     For example, you might have accidentally installed something in your home folder.

  7. Try running npm ls babel-jest in your project folder.
     This will tell you which other package (apart from the expected react-scripts) installed babel-jest.

If nothing else helps, add SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true to an .env file in your project.
That would permanently disable this preflight check in case you want to proceed anyway.

P.S. We know this message is long but please read the steps above :-) We hope you find them helpful!
